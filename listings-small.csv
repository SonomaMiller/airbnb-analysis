Our Space
---------------
Our space is hard to describe but we have been compared to a scrappy McMenamin's We have a large space but very clean and magical ( built as a hotel in 1904) our historical building has been lovingly restored .
We are not your usual space so please read carefully... think old school hotel / European hostel without the ghosts....or maybe there are ghosts you will have to see (wink wink) No ghosts that  are too precocious I promise :)
We have three shared and very clean bathrooms
One very well stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and the like provided) 
And if you enjoy a morning coffee or tea / or evening glass of wine (or smoke) we have a very expansive back porch with couches , tables and a designated smoking area (New Orleans meets Georgetown)

 If you are sick please do not travel.  I'm a fairly warm person, i like to give hugs but currently I am keeping social distancing and ask that if you visit us that you do also.  
About Me

In a time when the prevailing model seems to be anonymous key drops and hosts you never meet I shall continue to be a relic, making sure to greet you personally if at all possible, tell you a bit about the neighborhood, and just  generally make a human connection.  I've been doing this 10 years or so now and I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on how to be a good host.  I build, furnish, and clean both my units myself so I know exactly what you'll see when you arrive and I know that it will be done right.  I build spaces that I would want to (and frequently do) hang out in myself.  My units are unique, comfortable, and well located just a couple of blocks from the centre of one of the best neighborhoods to visit in Seattle.
So, if you're looking for an anonymous experience where you let yourself into someone's IKEA furnished basement that you can bring home hookers to with no one noticing or caring you might want to consider one of the many other offerings on Airbnb that will better cater to your needs...  This is not to say I will be a constant presence during your stay.  I generally welcome my guests and then leave them alone to enjoy their visit.  Some folks are more gregarious and I've also made many new friends over the past decade whom I enjoy staying in touch with.  That's really entirely up to you.
I will ask one, to me, very important thing of you as a guest, which is to communicate your arrival plans to me and to respond in a timely fashion when I ask about them.  I will send you carefully timed texts messages with things like directions, parking tips should you have a car, and so on.  I will go out of my way to get you in early if that is what you need and if it is at all possible.  I will store your bags for the day if you're checking out and want to enjoy your day without dragging them around.  I will offer suggestions and be available by text most of each day to help you out and make sure you have the best visit possible  But I'm not a trained monkey in a pill box hat sitting at the concierge desk all day waiting around on your mysterious arrival time.  I have a life, of sorts, and I arrange it around your schedule so that your travel days are smooth.  
I will probably ask you for you flight info if that's how you're coming in.  It's really not a big mystery and is super helpful to me in tracking early/late arrivals so I can be sure to be here when you arrive while also scheduling my ""life"".
I very much enjoy hosting.  I like meeting my guests and sharing my knowledge of my city with them.  This is not something I do because I screwed up and got in over my head on a bad mortgage.  Yes, I make part of my living this way.  No, I don't really need to.  My motivation is the hundreds of great reviews that you see here that are a reflection of all the wonderful people I've been lucky enough to meet and to pass a short time with over the years.  I would like you to be one of them.  People invariably ask me about bad experiences I've had.  I honestly have trouble thinking of any.  A few moments have been challenging (I still haven't found all the glitter from that wedding...) but most people are great when you meet them and, in my experience, none have any malice in their hearts or intentions when they arrive.  Perhaps some hosts bring that out in folks.  I don't.  We're totally going to get along.
